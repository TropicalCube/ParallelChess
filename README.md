# ParallelChess

There is a basic framework to build upon. Gonna need help to make it reactive tho. Idk how to do that shit.

Entry 2: Gonna make checkers first (might as well) as it's easier. Got a foundation for it down, but it's still fucked with bugs.

Entry 3: Fixed the bugs. Got a nice simple framework down for checkers or whatever the fuck.

Entry 4: I guess we are making checkers. You can now play a very strange version of checkers, where killing a piece gives you a bonus turn, and without the special "king piece" in checkers. Idk what its called. But otherwise, it works. Need to make everything scalable and responsive. It is shit in that regard.

Entry 5: Made it scalable, and it won't break upon being resized. Why its left aligned is anyone's guess tho. Gotta figure out how to center the board.

Entry 6: Adding checkers but without the king piece mechanic. There is still onemajor bug present. Will be fixed in the next patch.

Entry 7: Made checkerboard centered

Entry 8: Added fully funcitonal checkers without kingpiece mechanic.
